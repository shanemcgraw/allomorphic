# On the project #

I love good movies. My dad got me started on the giants; Hitchcock, Welles, Huston... all great. 

While there is a romance to film that cannot be replaced, I've found myself wanting to be able to engage my mind in the scene rather than passively watching the events transpire before me- experiencing what the silver screen can't give: smell, touch, etc.

While smelling the gunfire from Sam Spade's .45 isn't possible unless you're an unfortunate character in "The Maltese Falcon", there is a sense in which this can be visualized in the mind with greater detail while reading it off of a page.

Enter short stories. While many movie-lovers (myself included) don't have time to plunge into a 300 page novel, I believe the same essence of a good can be captured by a few pages and a bit more brain power. The only question- which kind of story are you feeling? Is it the charmed, heart-wrenching drama of Rick and Ilsa (here's looking at you, kid) in 1930's Morocco? ...Or the thought-planting thriller in the mind of a powerful business mogul's heir? Based on the three titles entered, the page will give (and continue to give, if prompted) a recommendation- engaging the user's mind in a way that isn't possible with a film.

Here's to engaging the mind! (And happy reading!)

# On Allomorphs #
What is an allomorph? 

One evening (as most evenings), I was digging around in a good dictionary and came across an interesting word: "Morpheme". A morpheme, according to my dictionary, is the smallest grammatical unit in a language. Take the oft-loved word "cat". This has three morphemes; the "ckk" sound, the "aa" sound, and the "tt" sound. 

Allomorphs are morphemes that sound different than each other, but have the same meaning. A quick Google search shows that the "-z" sound in "dogs" is an allomorph with "-s" sound in "hats"; they both describe a plurality, but they don't sound the same.

This is the concept this site was built upon. Although films may be quite different than a story that takes up a few pages, many contain similar meanings. Hopefully both give us the opportunity to think rightly about the world that we live in, either in agreement, or disagreement, with the story tellers that bring them into our lives.


# On the short story library #
Alas, the list is not nearly as long as I would like it to be, which means the number of unique stories that fit a particular list of genres is rather restricted, so the same story gets recommended for a broad-sweeping genre. 

Now, it could be that this isn't *only* because the library size is too long. After creating the stories.js file, let me tell you- a lot of the classics are just straight DRAMATIC! My goodness! I think I have 10 "drama" stories for every "colorful" one. Actually... 

*goes back to interpreter, runs filter function*

...turns out that's not a bad guess! 41 stories are labelled "drama", while only 4 are labelled "colorful". And interestingly enough, no drama stories are even slightly colorful.

In any case, I hope to expand this library so the user can get access to as many story types as possible, giving the user a more refined pick in story.

ON GOOD NARRATIVES
It's interesting to think that a short story and a movie are two different mediums that get at the same thing. 

ON THE SHORT STORY LIBRARY
Alas, the list is not nearly as long as I would like it to be, which means the number of unique stories that fit a particular list of genres is rather restricted, so the same story gets recommended for a broad-sweeping genre. 

Now, it could be that this isn't *only* because the library size is too long. After creating the stories.js file, let me tell you- a lot of the classics are just straight DRAMATIC! My goodness! I think I have 10 "drama" stories for every "colorful" one. Actually...

Hopefully both give us the opportunity to think rightly about the world that we live in, either in agreement, or disagreement, with the authors and filmmakers working hard to

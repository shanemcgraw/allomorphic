We want to give you a chance to hone your javascript fundamentals by building your very own project from scratch.

You might be wondering what project you should make in order to knock our socks off. It turns out that this illusion of a perfect project doesn't exist! One of the best parts of software is the creative freedom that comes with it. Writing code is fun, and we highly encourage you to use your creativity to explore different opportunities.

Here are some prompts to get the creative juices flowing:
- Is there some tedious task sucking hours of your time that you can automate? Solve a problem with the power of code software.
- Can you think of a game that would be fun to build?
- Are you a data nerd? Explore the world of AJAx and APIs, you can do a lot of fun things with data.
- Google is your friend! Software engineers would be nothing without it. Search around for projects that sound fun and tackle them. Please don't copy someone else's code though.

We want you to build something that you're proud to show off. Typically this means spending anywhere from 20 to 40 hours of work towards this project. While there's no 'best' project idea, we still do have some specific things that we look for. You should be able to follow these guidelines for any idea you choose.

Good things:
- Using higher-order functions. You got a taste of a few of these in your initial interview and we encourage you to explore this powerful idea even more. Bonus points if you write some yourself. Here are a couple of good resources for learning more about these:

- Using native methods. Objects, Arrays, Strings, and Numbers all have certain functions built into them. On your initial application, you might have split a string into an array of words using the String.split() method. These methods are awesome and can save a ton of time! Explore their capabilities and use them when appropriate. MDN is your best friend here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

- Good style and documentation - Good code is easy to read. You can do this by commenting areas that you think another engineer might have difficulty reading later on. Getting into the habit of commenting your code is a great practice. Also, check out the Airbnb style guide (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript ) for an example of good styling habits.

- Making sure that it works. We have fun playing with your projects and we can't do that if it has errors

Not so good things:
- Overusing frameworks instead of writing vanilla javascript (e.g. Angular, Backbone, React, Meteor). Frameworks are great and we don't want to stifle your curiosity, but it's important to have a rock solid understanding of the fundamentals in order to take full advantage of everything a framework has to offer. You'll learn a lot about frameworks while you're here.

- Writing very little code - While it's generally good practice to be concise, we want you to be proud of what you build! A small project sends us the message that you didn't take this project as seriously as we'd like you to.

We very much look forward to playing with your project.

Go forth and code!
